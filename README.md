## :page_facing_up: Description

This game is a demo of my skills, knowledge with Java & [libGDX](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx).
##### Stack: Java 21, Gradle 8.11, [libGDX](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx) 1.10, Lombok 1.18, Maven, Android Studio, Tiled (TMX Maps).
> [!NOTE]
> * For gameplay, see [gameplay.mp4](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TkbdMnFe6whaoUqQKZORxapOZRVnNOiO/view?usp=sharing).
> * [libGDX](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx) is compatible with any platform, including IOS & PC.
> * For project structure of Java classes, see [classes.svg](.github/pictures/classes.png).

## :rocket: Key Features

* [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/) for less code space, it automates creation of Builders, Setters, Getters, & many more.
* **Inheritance** from [`PlayGameScreen`](core/src/com/company/passtosurvive/levels/PlayGameScreen.java) abstract class with **Builder** & effective usage of abstract method `setCheckpoint` for [`Level`](core/src/com/company/passtosurvive/levels) Classes.
    * For [`PlayGameScreen`](core/src/com/company/passtosurvive/levels/PlayGameScreen.java), I created **Builder** myself b/c inheritance required `super`. 
* [`TileObject`](core/src/com/company/passtosurvive/models/TileObject.java) abstract class, to make contactListener call `inContactAct` method to trigger actions corresponding to the specific [`TileObject` child](core/src/com/company/passtosurvive/models).
* Created joystick by implementing [`Joystick`](core/src/com/company/passtosurvive/control/Joystick.java) class with Actor inheritance for communication with [libGDX](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx) API & implementing [`JoystickInputListener`](core/src/com/company/passtosurvive/control/JoystickInputListener) class for touch control which communicates with App using [libGDX](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx) API.
* Usage of diverse files to provide graphics, sound, animation, buttons, & text:
    * `.pack` - texture packs, tell the game in which part of a png file, the specific image is located.
    * [`.json`](assets/Buttons.json) - needed for all buttons in the game to set them a texture (pressed & released) from the `AllComponents.pack` file.
    * `.tmx` - maps that contains position for all the graphics & physical bodies on maps, use `.png` files as source of graphics.
* Doesnâ€™t use Viewport to scale graphics, all graphics are optimized for different screens using just the coefficient of width & height to screen for which graphics was originally scaled. This **ensures original aspect of ratio for every graphics**. This technique is most often used in `resize()` methods. See [Example](.github/pictures/screens.png).

## Info

* Platformer with 2 levels (each has 2 parts) and 2 skins for the player model. 
    * Second skin is applied after 20 restarts. After 20th restart, the game will show special animation for second skin instead of "Game Over" screen. 
* Player's velocity is dependent on joystick's pull. 
* There are 2 "Game Over" screens, 2 "Win" screens, and a "Pause" screen. 
* The game works in native resolution and native refresh rate of the phone.

## Prerequisites
* ##### Minimum Android Version: 4
